### Project Title
**Sharing `Bikeshare Script` on Github**

### Description
The script includes a `Python code` written to dig into data from databases of bike sharing services across three major US cities - _Chicago, New York, and Washington_. The code allows an interactive experience helping user to navigate statistics about the usage of these services. 

### Files used
_chiago-csv_
_new_york_city.csv_
_washington.csv_

### Credits
The Q&A section of the _Explore US Bikeshare Data_ on [Knowledge Platform] (https://knowledge.udacity.com/?nanodegree=nd104&page=1&project=328&rubric=1379) helped me to navigate around various challenges while writing the code. And seeing all the **different approaches taken by my fellow co-learners** inspired me and helped me to overcome the situations where i did not know, how to solve some of the issues with my code.
